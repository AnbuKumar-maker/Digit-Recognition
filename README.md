# Digit-Recognition
In this project, we are going to train a deep convolutional neural network to transcribe digits. Then we are going to use the data from the learning stage to allow the Pi Camera to read and recognize digits. The AI pipeline will be implemented using Scikit and OpenCV 3.3 for image manipulation and Keras which uses Tensorflow as a back-end for the deep learning part.
